Hello! I'm an engineering student at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu). I'm currently an intern at [Lambda Capital](https://lambdavp.com) focused on investment research and quantitative signals. This past summer, I interned at [Wealthstone Group](https://wealthstonegroup.com) where I focused on alternative asset portfolios.

At Purdue, I am an undergraduate researcher at the [AIM Research Group](https://ai4musicians.org/index.html) exploring applications of AI and ML for musicians. I am also a teaching assistant for ECE 20001 (Electrical Engineering Fundamentals).

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar with my band, reading and backpacking. If you'd like to see my formal résumé, collaborate, or just chat, feel free to reach out.
